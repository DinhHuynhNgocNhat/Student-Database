The commands to be implemented are:
1. Add new Course: Queries the user for the required data and creates the new course in the database.
2. List courses: Prints all courses in the database with their data.
3. Add new student: Queries the user for the required data (member data of Student and Address) and creates a new student in the database.
4. Add enrollment: Queries the user for a matrikel number, a course id and a semester and adds the enrollment. If the enrollment already exists, a warning messages is printed.
5. Print student: Queries the user for a matrikel number and prints the student including the enrolled courses and their results.
6. Search student: Queries the user for a string and prints the matrikel number, last name and first name of all students that have the provided string as substring in their first or last name.
7. Update student: Queries the user for a matrikel number. If the corresponding student is found in the data base, the properties (except for the matrikel number) are presented in a numbered list. Entering the item number allows the user to modify the property, entering "0" terminates the update.
The list of properties also includes the enrollments. When an enrollment is chosen for update, the user can remove the enrollment or enter a mark for the enrollment.
